# Task-Tracker-
A python project where you can track your tasks.

## When im done you can:
- Add, Update, and Delete tasks
- Mark a task as in progress or done
- List all tasks
- List all tasks that are not done
- List all tasks that are in progress
- List all tasks that are done

I got the idea from [[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)]
